					<h3>. . . And So Can You</h3>
					<p>

					<h2>What are we talking about today?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>User Stories</li>
						<li>Scenarios / User Scenarios</li>
						<li>Personas</li>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								There are other concepts that are used out there, some or all of which you've heard of: Use cases, user journeys, epics, and others.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why use them?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Broader communication vector than requirements</li>
						<li>Expanding participation in development</li>
						<li>Reorient toward people and realia</li>
						<li>Facilitate discussions of justice, scope, and priority</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>User Stories Proper</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>My own definition</h2>
						<p>User Stories describe something a person — a real live human being — might want to do so that someone building or changing an interaction will have some contextual knowledge as well as the consequent ability to attempt inferences or extrapolations.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								User Stories can be used independently or in Agile or other methodologies/processes.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Example</h2>
						<p>
							One template for a short form:<br/>
							<em>Because [context or mission], there is [goal] so in my [job] I need to [action].</em>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								The syntax is not set in stone. If a different order reflects your environment and priorities better, change the order. If different variables reflect your environment and priorities better, change the variables.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Semi-Real Example</h2>
						<p>
							<em>Because the library is a key partner in creating new knowledge, we want to guide researchers in using email archive files, so in my work as an archivist I need to be able to analyze them.</em>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Notes</h2>
						<p>
							These are sometimes written as "As a [persona] I want to [action] so I can [goal]", but I saw argument about putting the why first, and it resonated with me. That has a risk of having user stories that all have the same beginning, so a challenge is to find the meso-level reason and not always fall back to the institutional mission.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Personas</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>My own definition</h2>
						<p>
							Personas are imaginary people or categories of people, often with memorable titles or details, that describe notional aggregations of user stories and/or the presumed people for whom user stories are generated.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Of course, on the one hand every person is unique, and on the other ultimately there is a describable total user/audience group. As a matter of process, you could write personas and then user stories to fit them, or user stories and then see how personas coalesce from them, and then again iteration is often a good design principle.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why use them?</h2>
						<p>
							They help figure out how to design or develop at an appropriate level of detail. They're also a great way to figure out what that level of detail is.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Examples</h2>
						<p>
							Undergraduate, intermediate, non-Yale, university representative, application administrator, archivist, communications officer, transitory affiliate
						</p>
						<p><a href="https://yaleedu.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/YaleSpecialCollections/Shared%20Documents/Website%20Redesign/Personas/Final%20Personas%202023%20July.docx?d=w30529db8867a4ecaa5a8bfc3527f80e5&csf=1&web=1&e=TMP6bP">Beinecke Website Redesign Personas</a></p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								That is, personas can be defined along many axes. A project's personas don't all have to be along a single axis.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Notes and caveats</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Not immutable nor do they need to stand alone</li>
							<li>Should be understandable alone, but can come with elaboration text</li>
							<li>Presumption of a certain fixity of the type described</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Other options *waves hands* out there</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Persona spectrums (descriptions of ranges of behaviors or abilities)</li>
							<li>Mindsets (narratives of attitudes and emotional responses)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Scenarios</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>One definition</h2>
						<p><blockquote>
							Scenarios are a plausible story about a persona using the future product or service from start to finish.
						</blockquote></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							This is the skinniest section of this preso because I know the least about them. Fundamentally, though, scenarios combine personas and stories into a larger narrative. A scenario can be very tightly coupled to the models of user story and persona, or a scenario can be a more free-flowing narrative that further translates technical requirements into communicatable verbiage.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 style="text-transform:lowercase;">e.g.,</h2>
						<p>
							There is a Yale alumnx who had extensive email correspondence with Sex Panic! as part of their philanthropy. They'd like to donate this correspondence to Yale Library, but needs to review the collection for sensitive data that needs special handling. While they are highly proficient in email management, they are not at all proficient in bulk email review and assessment. They need access, consultation, tool training, and a working vocabulary for making their participation meaningful and the donation successful.

					<h2>Risks</h2>
					<ul style="font-size:smaller;">
						<li><dt>Mistaking the map for the territory</dt><dd>Believing that high levels of effort in creating stories and personas means you have described reality</dd></li>
						<li><dt>Not allowing for variation in other ways</dt><dd>For instance, user stories that box work into narrow paths. All models are wrong, some models are useful.</dd></li>
						<li><dt>Losing sight of the bigger picture</dt><dd>Do the small-scale things bind the large-scale things in undesirable ways?</dd></li>
						<li><dt>Technocracy finding a way</dt><dd>If you don't keep people in all their wholeness foremost in the process of creating stories, personas, and scenarios, you just have technocracy by the side door.</dd></li>
